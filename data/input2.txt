A quantum computer also known as a quantum supercomputer is a computation device that makes direct use of quantummechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on transistors Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits bits each of which is always in one of two definite states  or  quantum computation uses qubits quantum bits which can be in superpositions of states A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine also known as the universal quantum computer Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with nondeterministic and probabilistic computers one example is the ability to be in more than one state simultaneously The field of quantum computing was first introduced by Yuri Manin in  and Richard Feynman in  A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 
As of  quantum computing is still in its infancy but experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits Both practical and theoretical research continues and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes such as cryptanalysis
Largescale quantum computers will be able to solve certain problems much more quickly than any classical computer using the best currently known algorithms like integer factorization using Shors algorithm or the simulation of quantum manybody systems There exist quantum algorithms such as Simons algorithm which run faster than any possible probabilistic classical algorithm Given sufficient computational resources however a classical computer could be made to simulate any quantum algorithm quantum computation does not violate the ChurchTuring thesis
A classical computer has a memory made up of bits where each bit represents either a one or a zero A quantum computer maintains a sequence of qubits A single qubit can represent a one a zero or any quantum superposition of these two qubit states moreover a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of  states and three qubits in any superposition of  In general a quantum computer with  qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to  different states simultaneously this compares to a normal computer that can only be in one of these  states at any one time A quantum computer operates by setting the qubits in a controlled initial state that represents the problem at hand and by manipulating those qubits with a fixed sequence of quantum logic gates The sequence of gates to be applied is called a quantum algorithm The calculation ends with a measurement collapsing the system of qubits into one of the  pure states where each qubit is purely zero or one The outcome can therefore be at most  classical bits of information Quantum algorithms are often nondeterministic in that they provide the correct solution only with a certain known probability
An example of an implementation of qubits for a quantum computer could start with the use of particles with two spin states down and up typically written  and   or  and   But in fact any system possessing an observable quantity A which is conserved under time evolution such that A has at least two discrete and sufficiently spaced consecutive eigenvalues is a suitable candidate for implementing a qubit This is true because any such system can be mapped onto an effective spin system
Bits vs qubits
A quantum computer with a given number of qubits is fundamentally different from a classical computer composed of the same number of classical bits For example to represent the state of an nqubit system on a classical computer would require the storage of n complex coefficients Although this fact may seem to indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical counterparts care must be taken not to overlook the fact that the qubits are only in a probabilistic superposition of all of their states This means that when the final state of the qubits is measured they will only be found in one of the possible configurations they were in before measurement Moreover it is incorrect to think of the qubits as only being in one particular state before measurement since the fact that they were in a superposition of states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes of the computation
 
Qubits are made up of controlled particles and the means of control eg devices that trap particles and switch them from one state to another
For example Consider first a classical computer that operates on a threebit register The state of the computer at any time is a probability distribution over the  different threebit strings         If it is a deterministic computer then it is in exactly one of these states with probability  However if it is a probabilistic computer then there is a possibility of it being in any one of a number of different states We can describe this probabilistic state by eight nonnegative numbers ABCDEFGH where A  probability computer is in state  B  probability computer is in state  etc There is a restriction that these probabilities sum to 
The state of a threequbit quantum computer is similarly described by an eightdimensional vector abcdefgh called a ket Here however the coefficients can have complex values and it is the sum of the squares of the coefficients magnitudes   that must equal  These square magnitudes represent the probability amplitudes of given states However because a complex number encodes not just a magnitude but also a direction in the complex plane the phase difference between any two coefficients states represents a meaningful parameter This is a fundamental difference between quantum computing and probabilistic classical computing
If you measure the three qubits you will observe a threebit string The probability of measuring a given string is the squared magnitude of that strings coefficient ie the probability of measuring     the probability of measuring     etc Thus measuring a quantum state described by complex coefficients abh gives the classical probability distribution  and we say that the quantum state collapses to a classical state as a result of making the measurement
Note that an eightdimensional vector can be specified in many different ways depending on what basis is chosen for the space The basis of bit strings eg     is known as the computational basis Other possible bases are unitlength orthogonal vectors and the eigenvectors of the Paulix operator Ket notation is often used to make the choice of basis explicit For example the state abcdefgh in the computational basis can be written as
Operation
While a classical threebit state and a quantum threequbit state are both eightdimensional vectors they are manipulated quite differently for classical or quantum computation For computing in either case the system must be initialized for example into the allzeros string   corresponding to the vector  In classical randomized computation the system evolves according to the application of stochastic matrices which preserve that the probabilities add up to one ie preserve the L norm In quantum computation on the other hand allowed operations are unitary matrices which are effectively rotations they preserve that the sum of the squares add up to one the Euclidean or L norm Exactly what unitaries can be applied depend on the physics of the quantum device Consequently since rotations can be undone by rotating backward quantum computations are reversible Technically quantum operations can be probabilistic combinations of unitaries so quantum computation really does generalize classical computation See quantum circuit for a more precise formulation
Finally upon termination of the algorithm the result needs to be read off In the case of a classical computer we sample from the probability distribution on the threebit register to obtain one definite threebit string say  Quantum mechanically we measure the threequbit state which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state as described above followed by sampling from that distribution Note that this destroys the original quantum state Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability However by repeatedly initializing running and measuring the quantum computer the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased

Potential
Integer factorization is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers eg products of two digit primes By comparison a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using Shors algorithm to find its factors This ability would allow a quantum computer to decrypt many of the cryptographic systems in use today in the sense that there would be a polynomial time in the number of digits of the integer algorithm for solving the problem In particular most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the related discrete logarithm problem which can also be solved by Shors algorithm including forms of RSA These are used to protect secure Web pages encrypted email and many other types of data Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security
However other existing cryptographic algorithms do not appear to be broken by these algorithms Some publickey algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shors algorithm applies like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory Latticebased cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem which would break many lattice based cryptosystems is a wellstudied open problem It has been proven that applying Grovers algorithm to break a symmetric secret key algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly n invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm compared with roughly n in the classical case meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved AES would have the same security against an attack using Grovers algorithm that AES has against classical bruteforce search see Key size Quantum cryptography could potentially fulfill some of the functions of public key cryptography
Besides factorization and discrete logarithms quantum algorithms offering a more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics the approximation of Jones polynomials and solving Pells equation No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered although this is considered unlikely For some problems quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup The most wellknown example of this is quantum database search which can be solved by Grovers algorithm using quadratically fewer queries to the database than are required by classical algorithms In this case the advantage is provable Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered such as for finding collisions in twotoone functions and evaluating NAND trees
Consider a problem that has these four properties
The only way to solve it is to guess answers repeatedly and check them
The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs
Every possible answer takes the same amount of time to check and
There are no clues about which answers might be better generating possibilities randomly is just as good as checking them in some special order
An example of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess the password for an encrypted file assuming that the password has a maximum possible length
For problems with all four properties the time for a quantum computer to solve this will be proportional to the square root of the number of inputs It can be used to attack symmetric ciphers such as Triple DES and AES by attempting to guess the secret key 
Grovers algorithm can also be used to obtain a quadratic speedup over a bruteforce search for a class of problems known as NPcomplete
Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically many believe quantum simulation will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing
There are a number of technical challenges in building a largescale quantum computer and thus far quantum computers have yet to solve a problem faster than a classical computer David DiVincenzo of IBM listed the following requirements for a practical quantum computer
scalable physically to increase the number of qubits
qubits can be initialized to arbitrary values
quantum gates faster than decoherence time
universal gate set
qubits can be read easily
Quantum decoherence
One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere However other sources of decoherence also exist Examples include the quantum gates and the lattice vibrations and background nuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits Decoherence is irreversible as it is nonunitary and is usually something that should be highly controlled if not avoided Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular the transverse relaxation time T for NMR and MRI technology also called the dephasing time typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature
These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an oftencited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time
If the error rate is small enough it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction which corrects errors due to decoherence thereby allowing the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time An often cited figure for required error rate in each gate is  This implies that each gate must be able to perform its task in one th of the decoherence time of the system
Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems However the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits The number required to factor integers using Shors algorithm is still polynomial and thought to be between L and L where L is the number of bits in the number to be factored error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L For a bit number this implies a need for about  qubits without error correction With error correction the figure would rise to about  qubits Note that computation time is about L or about  steps and on  MHz about  seconds
A very different approach to the stabilitydecoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons quasiparticles used as threads and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates
Developments
There are a number of quantum computing models distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed The four main models of practical importance are
Quantum gate array computation decomposed into sequence of fewqubit quantum gates
Oneway quantum computer computation decomposed into sequence of onequbit measurements applied to a highly entangled initial state or cluster state
Adiabatic quantum computer or computer based on Quantum annealing computation decomposed into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian whose ground states contains the solution
Topological quantum computer computation decomposed into the braiding of anyons in a D lattice
The Quantum Turing machine is theoretically important but direct implementation of this model is not pursued All four models of computation have been shown to be equivalent to each other in the sense that each can simulate the other with no more than polynomial overhead

Relation to computational complexity theory 
The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called BQP for bounded error quantum polynomial time Quantum computers only run probabilistic algorithms so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of BPP bounded error probabilistic polynomial time on classical computers It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomialtime algorithm whose probability of error is bounded away from one half A quantum computer is said to solve a problem if for every instance its answer will be right with high probability If that solution runs in polynomial time then that problem is in BQP
BQP is contained in the complexity class P or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems PP which is a subclass of PSPACE
BQP is suspected to be disjoint from NPcomplete and a strict superset of P but that is not known Both integer factorization and discrete log are in BQP Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP and hence outside P Both are suspected to not be NPcomplete There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NPcomplete problems in polynomial time That is not known to be true and is generally suspected to be false
The capacity of a quantum computer to accelerate classical algorithms has rigid limitsupper bounds of quantum computations complexity The overwhelming part of classical calculations cannot be accelerated on a quantum computer A similar fact takes place for particular computational tasks like the search problem for which Grovers algorithm is optimal
Although quantum computers may be faster than classical computers those described above cant solve any problems that classical computers cant solve given enough time and memory however those amounts might be practically infeasible A Turing machine can simulate these quantum computers so such a quantum computer could never solve an undecidable problem like the halting problem The existence of standard quantum computers does not disprove the ChurchTuring thesis It has been speculated that theories of quantum gravity such as Mtheory or loop quantum gravity may allow even faster computers to be built Currently defining computation in such theories is an open problem due to the problem of time ie there currently exists no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output
LOV K GROVER is a member of the technical staff in physical sciences research at Bell Labs in Murray Hill New Jersey He is the inventor of what has been proven to be the fastest possible search algorithm that could run on a quantum computer 
IN THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE SECOND World War when France had fallen and German submarines prowled the Atlantic at will the finest minds in Britain w ere clustered in a place known as Bletchley Park There in low wooden buildings thrown up on the grounds of a country estate fifty miles northwest of London thousands of men and women worked furiously to decode the orders the Axis sent its ships and troops As intercepted radio messages chattered out of the teleprinters clerks would snatch them and copy them by hand onto standardized forms Then the cryptanalysts would take over Mostly they worked by hand comparing sheets of gridded paper running through permutations crossing off false starts staring shuffling guessing It worked For days or weeks the fog of war would clear as the Bletchley Park team found the keys to the Red and Light Blue ciphers of the Axis air force the naval and army Enigma ciphers and then triumphantly the supersecret Fish cipher of the German high command 
It seems astonishing that the fate of Europe may once have depended on pencil stubs and intuition Today when calculations become complex and the stakes are high ordinary brainpower almost always gets an electronic assist from a computerand the faster and more powerful the better Many of the hardest calculations still have to do with codesthough they are intended mostly to test security not compromise it But todays codes make Fish seem like the simple lettersubstitution ciphers beloved of puzzlers in childrens magazines a becomes b b becomes c and so forth One is the socalled RSA protocol which makes electronic banking possible by assuming banks and their customers that a bogus transfer of funds or a successful forgery would take the worlds fastest computer millions of years to carry out Another is the widespread Data Encryption Standard DES which remains secure for most ordinary business transactions 
Other calculations  searching the Internet modeling the national economy forecasting the weather  likewise strain the capacities of even the fastest and most powerful computers The difficulty is not so much that microprocessors are too slow it is that computers are inherently inefficient Modern computers operate according to programs that divide a task into elementary operations which are then carried out serially one operation at a time Computer designers have tried for some time to coax two or more computers or at least two or more microprocessors to work on different aspects of a problem at the same time but progress in such parallel computing has been slow and fitful The reason in large part is that the logic built into microprocessors is inherently serial Ordinary computers sometimes appear to be doing many tasks at once such as running both a wordprocessor and a spreadsheet program but in reality the central processor is simply cycling rapidly from one task to the next 
A truly parallel computer in contrast would have simultaneity built into its very nature It would be able to carry out many operations at once to search instantly through a long list of possibilities and point out the one that solves a problem 
Such computers do exist They are called quantum computers  not so much because they are inherently small but because they operate according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics which do indeed govern the world of the very small the waves and particles of subatomic physics One quantum rule in particular creates an enormous incentive to apply quantum mechanics to computing the startling discovery by twentiethcentury physicists that elementary particles such as protons neutrons and electrons can persist in two or more states at once That makes it possible at least in principle for them to be harnessed as processing units in a machine more efficient than any conventionally designed classical computer could ever be 
In the past few years simple quantum computers have been built in the laboratory Meanwhile in my field the theory of quantum computation investigators are eagerly describing what the more sophisticated machines will be like if they can ever be constructed We are if you will writing the software for a device that does not yet exist Yet on paper at least the prospects are stunning an algorithm that could factor digitlong numbers a billion  times faster than is currently possible with the best nonquantum methods a search engine that could examine every nook and cranny of the Internet in half an hour a bruteforce decoder that could unscramble a DES transmission in five minutes 
PERHAPS THE MOST SURPRISING THING ABOUT quantum computing is that it was so slow to get started Physicists have known since the s that the world of subatomic particles is a realm apart but it took computer scientists another halfcentury to begin wondering whether quantum effects might be harnessed for computation The answer was far from obvious 
Boiled down to its essentials any computer must meet two requirements it must be able to store information as strings of s and s or bits and it must have a way of altering the bits in accordance with instructions A computer transforms its bits by means of gates or devices designed to carry out simple operations in logic For example a NOT gate converts any input bit into its opposite  becomes l and  becomes  An OR gate by contrast converts two input bits into a single bit whose value is the higher of the two  OR  yields  any other combination gives  And an AND gate yields a  only if both input bits are s otherwise its output is a  Everything a computer does  whether synthesizing speech calculating the billionth digit of pi or beating Garry Kasparov at chess  ultimately comes about through the transformation of bits by gates 
Could subatomic particles store bits Could they form gates Consider the electron Every electron acts as if it were a little magnet spinning about an axis whose magnetic moment can point in only one of two directions up or down Thus the spin of the electron is quantized it has just two possible states which can readily be identified with the s and s of an ordinary computer processor And you can flip the bit  that is change a down or  to an up or l by adding just a smidgen of energy 
Suppose however you give it less energy than that  say half a smidgen Once again when you observe the electrons spin state you will find that the spin is quantized it points either up or down But now there is an important though subtle difference According to the rules of quantum mechanics the probability of observing the spin in one or the other state will change That change arises from a qualitatively new state with no analogue in the ordinary nonquantum laws of physics called a super position of the two spin states a combined inbetween condition that can be say  percent up and  percent down or  percent up and  percent down 
IN THE s AND EARLY s PHYSICISTS AND computer scientists began to investigate how the properties of quantum superpositions might be applied to computing Early workers in the field  including the physicists Charles H Bennett of the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights New York Paul A Benioff of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois David Deutsch of the University of Oxford and the late Richard P Feynman  showed that particles in superposed states can function as quantum bits or qubits and can undergo operations analogous to the NOT OR and AND operations of classical computing But that is not all Quantum computers if they can be built could achieve results that would seem almost magical  and quite different from anything a classical system has to offer 
Imagine a quantum computer made of two atomic nuclei acted on by an external magnetic field Suppose the nuclei belong to the neighboring atoms of carbon and hydrogen in a single molecule of chloroform CHCl Just as electrons do the nuclei align their spins with the magnetic field in the direction up  or down  One can now begin to compute with this toy system by tickling the nuclei with radio waves By tuning the frequency and duration of a radio pulse in just the right way it is possible to make one or the other nucleus flip its spin It is even possible to ensure that the hydrogen nucleus flips over only if the carbon nucleus is already pointing up In that case the quantized behavior of the two nuclei functions as what computer scientists call a controlledNOT gate with the carbon nucleus as the control In symbols with carbon in the first place and hydrogen in the second there are four possible inputs    and  ControlledNOT can then operate in one of four ways             Physicists and computer scientists have proved that by stringing together singlequbit operations and twoqubit controlledNOT gates it is theoretically possible to build a quantum computer capable of doing anything a classical computer can do 
BUT THE REAL MAGIC transpires when a twoqubit gate acts on a particle that is in a superposition of spin states First place the chloroform molecule in a strong external magnetic field that aligns both atomic nuclei into the down or  position Then with a pulse of tuned radio waves tweak the carbon nucleus so that it does a partial flip into a superposed state for which the probabilities for both spin directions are each  percent a singlequbit operation Finally carry out a controlledNOT operation with the carbon nucleus as the control qubit Because the second qubit the hydrogen nucleus started out in the zero state only two of the operations are relevant    and    In other words if the carbon nucleus had initially gotten flipped to a  the controlledNOT operation would flip the hydrogen nucleus into the  state too If the carbon had remained a  the controlledNOT operation would have left the hydrogen in the  state too But the action of controlledNOT on the superposed state of the carbon nucleus and the  state of the hydrogen nucleus leaves the twoqubit system as a whole in a more complicated superposition with a  percent chance of being in the  state and a  percent chance of being in the  state Such a superposition is called an EPR state after the physicists Einstein Bons Podolsky and Nathan Rosen who first studied it in  
Intensely puzzling aspects of the EPR state arise when the two qubits are physically separated and independently operated on Suppose you measure only the value of the first qubit the spin state of the carbon nucleus When you do that you run up against one of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics If an interaction gives any information about the state of a quantum system the rest of the system immediately readjusts itself to be consistent with that information In general any attempt to measure or observe a system in a superposition of two or more states immediately forces the system to make a decision Instead of continuing in its intermediate superposed state the quantum computer jumps into just one of the possible quantum states open to it In the language of quantum mechanics it decoheres 
By observing the carbon qubit of the EPR state then you force decoherence and destroy the superposition you had an even chance of observing a  or a  but you could observe only one or the other value But that observation also implies that the system as a whole cannot continue to be in its superposition of the two states  and  instead it too takes on a single definite state and so the hydrogen qubit assumes the same value as the carbon one In quantummechanical terms both states appear at the same time because the two nuclei have become entangled 
IF THAT WERE THE WHOLE STORY QUANTUM computing might not seem particularly interesting After all the final outcome is just two identical qubits  with random values at that The exciting thing about entanglement however is that you do not have to measure those values right away Instead you can leave the system in its superposed state and carry out any number of delicate and intriguing operations on the qubits before you finally decide to make an observation Meanwhile any quantum operation on the system acts on all of the states simultaneously If the number of qubits is q the total number of possible states is q 
Thus from say  particles you could in principle create a quantum system that is a superposition of as many as  states Each state would be a single list of  s and s Any quantum operation on that systema particular pulse of radio waves for instance whose action was say to execute a controlledNOT operation on the th and th qubitswould simultaneously operate on all  states Hence with one machine cycle one tick of the computer clock a quantum operation could compute not just on one machine state as serial computers do but on  machine states at once That number which is approximately equal to a  followed by  zeros is far larger than the number of atoms in the known universe Eventually of course observing the system would cause it to collapse into a single quantum state corresponding to a single answer a single list of  s and s  but that answer would have been derived from the massive parallelism of quantum computing 
The consequence is that for some purposes quantum computers would be so much faster than classical computers are that they could solve problems the classical computers cannot touch If functioning quantum computers can be built harnessing their potential will be just a matter of creating algorithms that carry out the right operations in the right order 
THAT REALIZATION HAS TOUCHED OFF AN explosion of research into the theory of quantum computing The field poses some unique challenges For one thing the mathematics involved in analyzing the evolution of a system of particles is daunting Just as you might fly from New York to Los Angeles either directly or via any of several hub airports a subatomic particle changing from one state to another can take several possible paths The difference is that whereas your plane can take only one of the available routes the particle acts like a wave that simultaneously takes them all Furthermore the probability of finding the particle along each path fluctuates from point to point and from moment to moment as if it were a wave with crests and troughs To evaluate the probability that any particular state will come to pass one must sum the probabilities of all the paths leading to that state being careful to keep the probability waves along each path in the proper phase 
Another obstacle is that quantum computers are extremely fragile To remain in an intermediate superposed state a quantummechanical system needs to be almost totally isolated from its environment the slightest interaction with anything outside itself will perturb the system destroy the superposition and upset the computation As a result anyone who wants to build a quantum computer must be careful to shield it from heat cosmic rays and other potential outside influencesincluding outside observers Moreover once your quantum computer has solved a problem for you your own need to read out the answer forces you to destroy the system 
The quirkiness of quantum systems goes a long way toward explaining why the most impressive studies in quantum computing so far have taken place on paper While experimenters struggle to build even rudimentary systems in the lab theorists have raced ahead to anticipate the software such computers will need should they ever become practical 
One essential piece of software for any computing technology is a way to correct errors Machines make mistakes Classical computers are designed to catch errors through redundancy They perform each elementary computation several times and then accept the most frequent answer as correct Such a majority rules approach would not work in quantum computers though because comparing answers would entail precisely what must be avoided observing the system before the computation is done 
Surprisingly however quantum error correction is possible In  the mathematician Peter W Shor now at ATT Labs in Florham Park New Jersey and the physicist Andrew M Steane of the University of Oxford independently devised a scheme that deftly tiptoes through the quantum minefield The scheme detects error in a way that reveals nothing about the ongoing computation and thus does not ruin the superposition Then it fixes the error by means of another quantum computation which also keeps the quantum system intact 
A SIMILARLY SUBTLE APPROACH HAS BEEN devised for factoring large numbers Factoring is what computer scientists call a oneway problem hard in one direction but easy in the other Suppose I asked you the question Which two integers can be multiplied to obtain the number  Systematically testing all the candidates might keep you busy for fifteen minutes or so But if I asked you to multiply  by  it would take you only about twenty seconds with pencil and paper to determine that the answer is  The lopsided difficulty of factoring compared with multiplication forms the basis for practical data encryption schemes such as the RSA protocol Large prime numbers  say a hundred digits each or so  make good passwords for such systems because they are easy to verify just multiply them together and see whether their product matches a number that is already stored or that might even be made publicly available Extracting the passwords from a digit composite product of two large primes however is equivalent to factoring the large composite number  a problem that is very hard indeed The largest number that ordinary supercomputers have been able to factor with nonquantum algorithms is only  digits long 
Quantum algorithms however are another matter In  Shor discovered one that makes factoring almost as efficient as multiplication In computer science one often tries to solve hard problems by converting them into simpler problems that one already knows how to solve In that spirit Shor started by employing wellknown results from number theory to convert the problem of factoring into one of estimating the periodicity of a long sequence Periodicity is the number of elements in the repeating unit of a sequence The sequence            for instance has a periodicity of four To estimate periodicity a classical algorithm must observe at least as many elements as there are in the period Shors algorithm does much better It sets up a quantum system made up of a large number of superposed states Each state is identified with an element of the repeating sequence A single quantum mechanical operation then transforms each superposed state in a way that depends on the value of the sequence to which the state corresponds A series of such quantum mechanical operations mathematically analogous to Xray diffraction is carried out on the superposed states 
The method works for much the same reason Xray diffraction enables mineralogists to deduce the periodicity of the crystal lattice of an unknown solid substance The periodic structure of the lattice allows only waves of certain wave lengths to propagate in any specified direction Similarly in Shors algorithm the quantum system of superposed states allows only certain of the wavelike probabilities associated with the quantum states to propagate the rest are canceled out or damped away The algorithm then calculates those propagating wavelengths estimates the periodicity of the superposed states and finally deduces the factors of the number The result is the fastest factoring algorithm known Factoring is a kind of search  a search for factors For other searches however a more generalpurpose algorithm is needed My own most important contribution to quantum computation is an efficient quantum mechanical algorithm for searching unsorted data bases That algorithm which I discovered in  is faster than any classical algorithm can ever be More than that it has been shown that no other quantum mechanical algorithm can ever beat it either 
IMAGINE YOU WANT to look up a phone number in a telephone directory that has a million entries Suppose too that you have forgotten the persons name all the information you have to search with is an address In that case your only recourse is trial and error On average you will read the names of  strangers before you find the one you want on a very bad day you might have to look at  of them A computer could search much faster but algorithmically it would be in the same boat in general a list of N items takes on average N steps to search 
A quantum computer could do much better thanks to its ability to carry out many operations at the same time Assuming you had access to a quantum system here is how you could do the search First choose enough particles some number q so that there are enough quantum states in the system q to assign at least one state to each name in the phone book To get a million names for instance you would need twenty particles since  is slightly more than a million Place the information from the phone book into quantum memory and match each name to a different quantum state Put the system into a superposition of the million or so states Now the system can do a computation that checks whether each of the names is the right name Thanks to quantum superposition the computation takes place on all states simultaneously 
At this stage the answer is in the system the trick is to get it out Observing the system without further processing would instantly collapse the superposition into one of its million entangled states but the chances that that state will be the one that gives you the name you need would be just one in a million You might just as well have picked a name at random from the phone book 
The way around the problem then is further processing a sequence of quantum mechanical operations on the superposed states that amplifies the probability that when the superposition is observed it will collapse only into the state corresponding to the desired name That is what my search algorithm does Like Shors factoring method the algorithm takes advantage of the wavelike nature of probability in a quantum computer 
To take a relatively straightforward example of how the process works suppose you want to find a name in a phone book that has only four entries To set up your quantum computer you decide to compute with a pair of particles  for variety choose protons this time  and you arrange things so that each name in the phone book corresponds to a distinct combination of spins    or  Now suppose that unbeknownst to you the name you want to find corresponds to the third state  That state is the target 
YOU BEGIN BY INITIALIZING THE SPINS OF THE protons with a strong magnetic field aligning both of them in the up direction Then you give each particle a fainter dose of magnetism just enough energy to change the spin state to a superposition that is  percent up and  percent down a  percent flip The twoparticle system has now become a superposition of the four possible combinations of spins each with a probability of  
In quantum mechanics each probability is treated mathematically as the square of a theoretical but not directly observable construct called the probability amplitude Strictly speaking what my search algorithm manipulates are probability amplitudes The advantage of working with probability amplitudes is that unlike actual probabilities they can be either positive or negative and so they can cancel one another out just as waves do in water The algorithm makes use of that property by canceling computational paths that initially seem promising but that later turn out to be dead ends 
Since each of the four superposed states has a probability of  the probability amplitude of each state in my twoparticle example can be either  or  technically in fact it can even be a complex number The algorithm ensures that all the probability amplitudes begin with the same value     Now comes the heart of the algorithm The first operation changes the sign of the amplitude of the target state in my example the third state thus the amplitudes change to     That is possible because in a sense when the quantum computer is in the target state it can verify that it is indeed in the right state and can then invert the phase in that state Note that this operation reveals nothing to the outside world because the probabilities  that is the squares of the probability amplitudes  remain unchanged 
Next come three quantum operations a  percent flip an operation that inverts the phase of one of the states and another  percent flip The net effect is a maneuver called inversion about the average If you imagine the average value as a crossbar whose height is equal to the average value of the amplitudes with the various individual amplitudes jutting up or dangling down from it you invert each amplitude by flipping it over to the opposite side of the bar 
What is the net effect The average of the amplitudes in the four states after changing the sign of the amplitude of the target state is   l      or  The first state has an amplitude of l  which is  above the average and so after the inversion about the average its amplitude becomes  below the average or  A similar calculation for each state shows that the amplitudes become     The square of each of those numbers gives the probability of each state In other words the effect of the operations is to drive the quantum computer into the target state the probability of the target state  has reached certainty If you now observe any of the spins of the protons the quantum superpositions will collapse into a display of the right answer 
MOST SEARCHES OF COURSE WOULD SCAN a list longer than four items To do so the algorithm might repeat the three quantum operations many times nudging the system toward the desired state with every pass through the loop What makes quantum searching so powerful is that for a list of N items the algorithm requires only about the square root of N steps to find its quarrynot the N steps of the classical trialanderror search Thus a quantum computer could search a millionname phone book in  tries instead of half a million The longer the list the more dramatically the quantum algorithm will outpace its classical rival 
The algorithm is good for more than merely looking up phone numbers It can search through items not explicitly spelled out on a list and so it can take a bruteforce approach to any problem whose potential solutions can be systematically enumerated trying them all until it stumbles on a solution that works Nonquantum versions of the bruteforce approach are already a staple of computing such algorithms are applied in programs that play games such as chess Because of its speed and versatility it seems likely that the search algorithm will be a key component in the software of the future 
IF THE TWENTYFIRST CENTURY IS TO BE AN AGE of quantum computers some major advances will be necessary Certainly the working models built to date come nowhere near their theoretical potential Even factoring twodigit numbers remains beyond them The most promising approach so far is a spinoff from the medical technology of nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging The computers are molecules in a liquid and information is encoded in atomic nuclei in the molecules Instead of trying to coax results out of a few fragile qubits the technique is based on manipulating or in effect programming enormous numbers of nuclei with radiofrequency pulses and then harnessing statistics to filter the right answers about one result in a million out of the background of noise 
In  the physicists Isaac L Chuang of the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose California Neil A Gershenfeld of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and Mark G Kubinec of the University of California Berkeley built a simple twoqubit NMR quantum computer made of liquid chloroform The program the computer ran was my search algorithm applied to a list of four items More recently a group at the University of Oxford built a similar device out of two hydrogen nuclei in the organic chemical cytosine Threequbit NMR quantum computers running Shors and Steanes errorcorrection routine were demonstrated in  by Raymond Laflamme and his coworkers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico 
Will quantum computers ever grow into their software How long will it take them to blossom into the powerful calculating engines that theory predicts they could be I would not dare to guess but I advise all wouldbe forecasters to remember these words from a discussion of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator ENIAC in the March  issue of Popular Mechanics Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with  vacuum tubes and weighs  tons computers in the future may have only  vacuum tubes and weigh only  tons

The key features of an ordinary computerbits registers logic gates algorithms and so onhave analogous features in a quantum computer Instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way Where a bit can store either a zero or a  a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in betweenand be in multiple states store multiple values at the same time If that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time Schrodingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus A gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals If you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency the basic note youre playing and lots of overtones or harmonics higherfrequency multiples of the fundamental The wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously theyre added together to make a combined wave that includes them all Qubits use superposition to represent multiple states multiple numeric values simultaneously in a similar way
Just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously Instead of working in serial doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence it can work in parallel doing multiple things at the same time Only when you try to find out what state its actually in at any given moment by measuring it in other words does it collapse into one of its possible statesand that gives you the answer to your problem Estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer if only we could build it So how would we do that
In reality qubits would have to be stored by atoms ions atoms with too many or too few electrons or even smaller things such as electrons and photons energy packets so a quantum computer would be almost like a tabletop version of the kind of particle physics experiments they do at Fermilab or CERN Now you wouldnt be racing particles round giant loops and smashing them together but you would need mechanisms for containing atoms ions or subatomic particles for putting them into certain states so you can store information knocking them into other states so you can make them process information and figuring out what their states are after particular operations have been performed
Quantum theory is the branch of physics that deals with the world of atoms and the smaller subatomic particles inside them You might think atoms behave the same way as everything else in the world in their own tiny little waybut thats not true on the atomic scale the rules change and the classical laws of physics we take for granted in our everyday world no longer automatically apply As Richard P Feynman one of the greatest physicists of the th century once put it Things on a very small scale behave like nothing you have any direct experience about or like anything that you have ever seen
If youve studied light you may already know a bit about quantum theory You might know that a beam of light sometimes behaves as though its made up of particles like a steady stream of cannonballs and sometimes as though its waves of energy rippling through space a bit like waves on the sea Thats called waveparticle duality and its one of the ideas that comes to us from quantum theory Its hard to grasp that something can be two things at oncea particle and a wavebecause its totally alien to our everyday experience a car is not simultaneously a bicycle and a bus In quantum theory however thats just the kind of crazy thing that can happen The most striking example of this is the baffling riddle known as Schrodingers cat Briefly in the weird world of quantum theory we can imagine a situation where something like a cat could be alive and dead at the same time
What does all this have to do with computers Suppose we keep on pushing Moores Lawkeep on making transistors smaller until they get to the point where they obey not the ordinary laws of physics like oldstyle transistors but the more bizarre laws of quantum mechanics The question is whether computers designed this way can do things our conventional computers cant If we can predict mathematically that they might be able to can we actually make them work like that in practice all right
